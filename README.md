Cheers to SolDoesTech, I used his script HyprV4 in order to kick start the whole setup, I highly recommend you to use it his script first and then change things as you wish

Uses Rofi as the main menu for things like:

  - Clipboard
  - Start applications
  - Change BG
  - Choose SSH to login in
  - Pause, change ... music
